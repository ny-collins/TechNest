## 🧩 Project Overview

TechHaven is a fully responsive, gadget-themed website built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It reimagines the structure of the Solus mental wellbeing template but adapts it into a tech-centric experience focused on visual clarity, interactivity, and mobile-first performance.

## 🎨 Color System

This site uses a custom color palette to communicate trust, innovation, and excitement:

| Role        | Color       | HEX      | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Primary     | Coral Red   | `#ff6b6b` | Draws attention to CTAs, e.g., buttons and icons |
| Secondary   | Navy Blue   | `#1e2a38` | Conveys trust, stability, and tech focus |
| Accent      | Soft Blue   | `#4a90e2` | Adds vibrant highlights without overwhelming the visual hierarchy |
| Background  | Soft Gray   | `#f2f4f7` | Gentle contrast that supports readability |

All text/background and button contrasts pass WCAG AA checks for legibility and accessibility.

## 📱 Breakpoint Logic

The site implements a **mobile-first** approach with three main breakpoints:

- **SM (<768px)**: 
  - Navbar becomes a Lottie-animated hamburger menu
  - Stacked layouts for testimonials, product grid, and support cards
  - Reduced padding for compact vertical flow

- **MD (768–1024px)**:
  - Grid elements appear in 2-column layout
  - Carousel buttons are repositioned for usability
  - Spacing and font sizes scale moderately

- **LG (>1024px)**:
  - Precise layout alignment with Solus mockup's card sizes and spacing
  - Testimonials, footer, and product grids retain horizontal flex/grid layouts
  - All enhancements and color stylings deviate from the original mockup per assignment

## 🧠 Creative Divergence from Mockup

While preserving the card structure and layout spacing at large breakpoints, TechHaven takes several creative liberties:

- Rebranded from Solus (mental wellness) to TechHaven (gadget retail)
- Introduced an ecommerce-style product grid with real device images
- Changed testimonials content and layout to simulate authentic customer reviews
- Added interactive features like Lottie hamburger menu and animated scroll effects
- Designed new "How it Works" section tailored to online tech shopping

## 🧪 Tools Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Lottie for animated SVG hamburger
- FontAwesome for social icons
